I guess he would start his day by writing music. While I was practicing some of his piano sonatas, there were a lot of questions popped into my head. How did he organize the voicing? Why did he choose to use a diminished chord here? What was in his mind when writing this beautiful melody? After some deep work, we can relieve some stress by learning how he practices the piano. Do they use metronomes at that time? Do they practice scales and arpeggio too?Since I have so many answers I\u2019d like to know, I should bring a notebook and a smartphone with me. Undoubtedly, if someone could have a selfie with Brahms, that would be one of the coolest things in the world!"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In the afternoon, I think he would do some conducting. No matter if it\u2019s part of his income source to compose more, or even do some rehearsal of his drafts before going live. Last, I would like to end the enriching day in fine dining.
