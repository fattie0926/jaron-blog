**Atomic Habits by James Clear (Notes till P. 85)**

## The Fundamentals

### 1. The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
- Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold.  
- The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.  
- If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your systems instead.  

### 2. How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
- The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to **become a reader**.  
- The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to **become a musician**.  
- The goal is not to make videos, the goal is to **become a content creator**.  

The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior.

**Examples:**  
- Write each day â†’ creative person  
- Train each day â†’ athletic  

**Every action reinforces identity:**  
- Each time you write a page, you are a **writer**.  
- Each time you practice the violin, you are a **musician**.  
- Each time you make a video, you are a **creator**.  

**2 steps to identity-based habits:**  
1. Decide the type of person you want to be.  
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.  

**3 Levels of change:**  
- Outcome â†’ Process â†’ Identity  

_Ask yourself: Who do you wish to become?_

### 3. How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
**Problem Phase â†’ Solution Phase**  
Cue â†’ Craving â†’ Response â†’ Reward  

> Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted.  

#### How to Create a Good Habit
- **Cue**: Make it obvious.  
- **Craving**: Make it attractive.  
- **Response**: Make it easy.  
- **Reward**: Make it satisfying.  

_Ask yourself: How can I make it obvious / attractive / easy / satisfying?_  

#### How to Break a Bad Habit
- **Inversion of Cue**: Make it invisible.  
- **Inversion of Craving**: Make it unattractive.  
- **Inversion of Response**: Make it difficult.  
- **Inversion of Reward**: Make it unsatisfying.  
### 5. The Best Way to Start a New Habit
**Implementation Intentions:**  
> I will **[BEHAVIOR]** at **[TIME]** in **[LOCATION]**.  

**Habit Stacking:**  
> After I **[CURRENT HABIT]**, I will **[NEW HABIT]**.  

**Examples:**  
- After I sit at the desk, I will open my textbooks to study.  
- After I see the calendar, I will perform the current event immediately.  
- After I arrive home, I will take a shower.
